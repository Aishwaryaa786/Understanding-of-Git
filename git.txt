First step:
After uploading the files in  the new repository you will have to copy the link from the code section


cd C:\Users\aramaiah.ASUAD\Naresh_IT\MyDataScience\Git_Sessions\Session_30


git clone https://github.com/Aishwaryaa786/EDA_DataScience.git


Step_1: You clone a repository
	a new folder is created
	in the command prmt go to that specific folder by typing ==> cd <branch name>

Step-2: To figure out if the branch is main branch or not we need to write this code, ==> git branch -a , this would show if the branch is 
	main or not 
Step-3: Here we make a different dev file by making use of a new branch of div called ==> git branch dev
										      ==> git branch -a ,==here we will have div first and
											then we have the mai branch 
Step-4:Code is shifted to dev branch 
	=here i do to the normal file and do the changes,
	= EDA Session 2 is what I modified hence need to go to the CMD and do the changes 
	= in CMD write ==> git status
	= It will show the specific fle in which you have done changes 

Step-5: Here we do the changes and save it so we put ==>git add .
	after which we try to save the content and know the status ==>git status
	the conetnt will be shwn in green colour
	then we are in right path 
Step-6: to show the msg once the code is updated we are supposed to write the following code
	git commit -am<msg>
	git commit -am "workspace updated"
Step-7: in order to push he changes or to see the relection of the changes which we have made in the Command promt in the 
	git hub protal we are supposed write the below command
	git config --global user.email "rkaish19986@gmai.com


open the EDA file 
again modify it
save it 
git status 
git add .
git status: red
git staus: green 
git commit -am "workspace updated"
git push origin dev 

Step -8 : To delete the branch we are supposed to write the code this way ==> git push origin -delete dev
